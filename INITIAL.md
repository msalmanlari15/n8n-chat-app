## FEATURE:

- Modern chat application built with NextJS 14+ and ShadCN UI components
- Real-time communication with n8n workflows via webhook integration
- Session management with MockAPI for chat history and user sessions
- Dynamic response rendering system supporting multiple content types (text, JSON, images, charts)
- Collapsible sidebar (sidebar-07) with icon mode for optimal space utilization
- Earth-toned design system with light/dark mode toggle
- Real-time interim message streaming from n8n workflow before final response
- No generic "AI is thinking" messages - shows actual workflow progress

**ðŸ“‹ For detailed product requirements, user stories, technical specifications, and implementation roadmap, refer to `mvp_prd.md`**

## EXAMPLES:

In the `examples/` folder, there is a README for you to read to understand what the example is all about and also how to structure your own README when you create documentation for the above feature.

- `examples/components/` - React components (ChatMessage.tsx, MessageInput.tsx, Sidebar.tsx)
- `examples/hooks/` - Custom React hooks (useChat.ts)
- `examples/lib/` - Utility libraries (mockapi-client.ts, n8n-client.ts)
- `examples/types/` - TypeScript type definitions (index.ts)
- `examples/n8n/` - n8n webhook integration examples (webhook-examples.md)
- `examples/themes/` - Design system implementation with custom CSS variables (globals.css)

Don't copy any of these examples directly, it is for a different project entirely. But use this as inspiration and for best practices.

## DOCUMENTATION:

- **MVP PRD**: `mvp_prd.md` - Complete product requirements document with technical specifications
- ShadCN UI documentation: https://ui.shadcn.com/
- NextJS 14+ documentation: https://nextjs.org/docs
- ShadCN Sidebar component: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/sidebar
- ShadCN sidebar-07 block: https://ui.shadcn.com/view/sidebar-07
- TailwindCSS documentation: https://tailwindcss.com/docs
- MockAPI documentation: https://mockapi.io/docs
- n8n webhook documentation: https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/
- Radix UI primitives: https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- **ðŸ“‹ PRIMARY REFERENCE**: Use `mvp_prd.md` for complete technical specifications, data models, and acceptance criteria
- Use the specific earth-toned design system provided in globals.css with custom CSS variables
- Implement proper TypeScript types for n8n webhook payloads and responses (see mvp_prd.md section 4.3)
- Session management should use local storage for session IDs and MockAPI for persistence
- Real-time message streaming: n8n sends interim messages â†’ display as separate bubbles â†’ final response streams
- Message renderer must handle multiple content types dynamically (text, JSON, images, charts)
- Sidebar must use collapsible="icon" mode and include light/dark theme toggle in profile section
- No localStorage/sessionStorage in artifacts - use React state management
- Proper error handling for n8n webhook failures and network issues
- Mobile-responsive design with proper sidebar behavior on small screens
- Use ShadCN Chart components for data visualization responses from n8n
- Implement proper loading states without generic "AI thinking" messages
- Session CRUD operations: create, rename, delete, switch between sessions
- Use ShadCN Toast components for notifications and alerts
- Implement proper accessibility features with keyboard navigation support
- **ðŸ“‹ IMPLEMENTATION PHASES**: Follow the 5-phase implementation roadmap outlined in mvp_prd.md
- **ðŸ“‹ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**: Ensure all functional, technical, and UX requirements from mvp_prd.md are met
